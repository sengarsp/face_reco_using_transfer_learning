# Face Recognition using the Transfer Learning and VGG16
Face-Recognition-
In this we have used the Transfer Learning for training the model and recognition the faces.
# TASK 4:-
To create a model which detect the face or make a face detection model using the transfer learning

# Solution :-
We have used the VGG16 to train the model with our images .
# Step 1:-
We have import the pre-trained model or load the VGG16 model.
